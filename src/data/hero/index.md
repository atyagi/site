    Technology has always been one of my first and foremost passions. 
    I'm always interested in new ideas and thoughts that can push the limits
    of what we can do forward.
    Some of my latest interests have been in Machine Learning, Data Analysis,
    Cloud Computing, and Infrastructure as Code.
