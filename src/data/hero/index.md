  Technology has always been one of my first and foremost passions. 
  I'm always interested in new ideas and thoughts that can push the limits
  of what we can do forward.
  <br><br>
  Some of my latest interests have been in Machine Learning, Data Analysis,
  and Cloud Computing, especially applied in unique and interesting ways.
  <br><br>
  In my free time, I enjoy cooking and food, music, and sports.
