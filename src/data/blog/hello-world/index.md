Hello! Having worked as a software engineer for nearly 10 years now, a question I receive all too commonly is 
"do you know how to make websites?". Based on this site, looks like I do. All jokes aside, this has been on the 
list of things to do for quite some time, and it feels good to get the framework in place to start putting in more 
posts/articles.

My plan is to write about the things that interest me in software and technology. Some things that are interesting
to me right now are:

- Machine Learning/Data Science
- Cloud Computing and AWS
- IoT and Connected Homes
- Event Driven Architectures
- Clean and Practical Coding

These are certainly very broad topics, but the hope is to narrow in on interesting applications within these
broader fields. To kick things off, the first post will be about the underlying technology that's powering
this site.
